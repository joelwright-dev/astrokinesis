# Running the game

You will need a few Python packages to run the game.
1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed
2. Run `python3 -m pip install opencv-python mediapipe`
3. Once those are installed, start the game by double clicking `play.bat`.

We're going to work on some bug fixes and polishing when we have time, but until then hope you have fun playing around with your new telekinetic abilities!
